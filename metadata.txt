description=This plug-in helps with downloading data from Lizard in QGIS.

about=The purpose of this plug-in is to be able to download data from the Lizard API into QGIS. Lizard is a framework for showing water and meteo-related information. It is a cloud solution, meaning that you can use it everywhere. As a user, you'll get an account which you can use immediately. Updates of the software and the data are done automatically in the background. You will have the latest data within your grasp. With this plugin, you can download data from the Lizard API (a REST API). You can either download private data with your Lizard account or public data (for which no login is required). Lizard holds vector data (also known as assets), raster data, time series and events. This plugin currently contains only vector data. Pumpstations and pipes are examples of included vector data. Future versions might also contain raster data, time series and events. You can also choose a spatial filtering: 'Current view' (current extent) or 'All data'. For more information about Lizard: https://www.lizard.net/ For more information about the Lizard API: https://demo.lizard.net/doc/ Requirements: QGIS version 2.0
